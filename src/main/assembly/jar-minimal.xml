			<! - - Not sure if this works always, but should do better than the purely 
				hardcoded solution (in EvoSuite.java for retrieving the evosuite-io jar file 
				as a resource) that was used so far. Now if the build process was successful, 
				we can be sure there is an "evosuite.jar" inside the "jar-minimal" version. 
				If the build process is not successful because <source> cannot be found, 
				we see why and simply fix the path. However, a neater solution to this is 
				appreciated! ;-) - - >
