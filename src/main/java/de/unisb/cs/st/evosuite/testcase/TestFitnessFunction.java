	 * lower difficulty with vertices near the root-branch of their method.

	 * postponed initially

	 * 
	 * If this method does not get overwritten preordering of goals by
	 * difficulty obviously won't work and disabling it using
	 * Properties.preorder_goals_by_difficulty is encouraged in order to avoid
	 * unnecessary performance loss
	 * 
	 * Also the whole idea of the difficulty value is to boost the performance
	 * gain in terms of GA-evolutions the ChromosomeRecycler is supposed to
	 * achieve. So if recycling is disabled or not implemented preordering
	 * should be disabled too.
