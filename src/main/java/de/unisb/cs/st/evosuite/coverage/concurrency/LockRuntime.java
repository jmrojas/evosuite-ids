/**
 * This class has two functions: 1) It holds some static data heavens. Which are
 * used by the concurrency test case generation to map certain values from the
 * instrumentation (premain/javaagent) time to the runtime 2) It is used as at
 * runtime to conveniently access the controllerRuntime. I.e. static methods are
 * easier to call from bytecode. Therefore we use static methods on this class
 * to map to controller methods. Before each run, this class has to be
 * initialized with a new controllerRuntime object
