/*
// (0) TODO IDEA FOR AN EVO-SUITE-FEATURE: 
//		 given a test(suite) for a class, check how many goals of each coverage criterion it covers
// (1) DONE detect which LV in which methodCall
//		i don't think this needs to be done anymore. its not possible to cover a use in a method call for a LV without covering a definition first
// (2) DONE cut ExecutionTrace for branch-fitness-evaluation to Trace of current object only
// 	    subTODO: first mark MethodCalls in ExecutionTracer.finished_calls with a methodID and the current objectID
// 			 then kick out all non-static MethodCalls for objects other then the one with current objectID
//			 if goalDef is for a LV, also consider MethodCalls individually (OUTDATED! s. above)		
// (3) DONE cut ExecutionTrace for branch-fitness-evaluation to Trace of a certain path (between goalDef and overwritingDef)
//  subTODO: in a MethodCall from the ExecutionTracer add another list holding information about the current duConter
//			 then allow for cutting the ExecutionTrace in a way that it only holds data associated for duCounters in a given range
// (4) DONE idea: 	once goalDef is covered, look at all duCounterPositions of goalDef (goalDefPositions):
//				if goalUse is covered any of these goalDefPositions, return 0
//				if not return the minimum over all branchUseFitness in the trace
//				where the trace is cut between the goalDefPosition and the next overwritingDefinition
//		turns out you don't need to cut between goalDefs and overwritingDefs
//		all u need to do is filter out all traces where the goalDef is not active for use-fitness-calculation
// (5) DONE:	well that didn't turn out too well. you have to consider all passed definitions
//				separately as described in (3) and (4) after all - see for example MeanTestClass.mean()

// Other things one could/should do: (TODO-list)
//	- display local variable names as in source code
//	- take different methodIds into account! 
//	- right now there seems to be a bug when definitions at the end of a method 
//		are paired with a use at the beginning of it
//	- inter.method and inter.class data flow analysis
//	- implement DefUseCoverageSuiteFitness
//	- various optimizations
// 	- TODO: for example one should reuse tests that reach a certain definition or use 
//		when looking for another goal with that definition or use respectively
 * 		idea: implement some sort of chromosome pool for each CUT
 * 			- keep track of "good" chromosomes, that cover defs and uses and 
 * 				use them for initial population when looking for goals concerning these DUs
 *  - also if one would implement the above point it would be very profitable to
 *  	order the goals such that easy goals are searched for first and for harder ones (deep in the CDG) later  
//	- fix control dependencies analysis
//	- implement real ReachingDefinitions algorithm
//	- even more information in resulting tests?
 * 		- cool would be to mark the statements in the test that caused the covering hits to goalUse and goalDef!
 *  - handle exceptions
 *  - worry about rounding errors: all that normalizing is insane
 *  	- should stretch the range for possible CoverageFitness to something like 0-100 at least
 *      - might want to make a fitness bigger/more precise then double  
 *  - care for integer overflows (especially in alternative fitness calculation)
 *  - DONE: private methods don't seem to be a problem at all. they don't need special treatment
 *  - TODO: clean up TestSuiteGenerator! 
 *  	- DONE: At least check for all remaining uncovered goals if 
 *  			they are covered by the test that just covered a goal
 *  
 *  - DONE: Kick out ControlDependencyTestClass-loops that take forever!
 *  - handle timeouts in tests
 *  - refactor: separate DefUseCoverageGoal and DefUseCoverageTestFitness
 *  - implement hashCode() functions?
 *  - NoStoppingCondition .. maybe even serialize populations and resume evolving later
 *  - now this is more of a theoretical one but still:
 *   	- how does one find the "perfect" configuration for the GA?
 *   	- well build another GA to find out, each chromosome is a configuration
 *   	- mutation and crossovers seems very easy
 *   	- fitness is calculated depending on covered goals, time needed / goal, consumed resources etc
 *   ... i would so love to do that :D
 *   - SearchStatistics ... well ... where to start :D
 *   	- i think the report is a very essential part of EvoSuite
 *   	- it's the way users will in the end see EvoSuite and maybe even the way they interact with it (TODO? :) )
 *   	- there is so much cool stuff one could do:
 *   	- give a complete analysis of the CUT in terms of different coverage perspectives
 *   	- provide the user with the possibility to compare different runs
 *   	- link test run information to analysis
 *   	- polish test run view: 
 *   		- jump to different parts (fitness, tests, etc)
 *   		- make things "expandable" (you know hide/show all test cases with a small -/+ next to it and stuff like that)
 *   		- show TestCase comments
 *   		- even better: link tests to goals they cover, see analysis part above
 *   		- mark where in a test a certain goal is covered:
 *   			- color lines differently depending on goal one hovers his mouse above in the covered goal description
 *    		- ... i could go on but i guess one gets the point
 *    	
 *    - in order to do all that SearchStatistics should be get a complete refactor-marathon-overhaul:
 *    	- make distinction between HTML-generation and statistics part, interlink them via .csv-files
 *    	- maybe don't generate any HTML at all but rather just put all relevant data in 
 *    		.csv-files together with plots in a special directory which in turn can be 
 *    		visualized in all kinds of ways. out the top of my head i'd say PHP would be very suited for that
 *     
 *    	- maybe encapsulate different HTML-generation-parts in separate classes like one for Code, one for plots etc.
 *    	- well just come up with a nice class model is all i'm trying to say i guess
 *    	- srsly though, this SearchStatistcs class is a mess :D and buggy as hell too it seems
 * - found a bug: s. ExceptionTestClass: sometimes passedLine is called before enteredMethod in instrumented code
 * - so DefUseCoverage goal computation scales pretty badly, why not separate goal analysis part and test creation
 * 		like with -setup you could run -analyze_goals or something and it would serialize the goals on disc
 * 		so the computed goals can be reused in later test creations ... srsly analysis takes minutes on bigger CUTs! 

 *  
 * things to write about:
 *  - DefUse is just awesome!
 *   - better chance of passing hard branches (?)
 *   - more thorough tests
 *   - #times each branch is executed
 *  - infeasible path problem
 *  - extract future work from unfinished ToDo-list ;)
 *  - why alternative definition
 *   - different modes, pro and cons
 *    - average doesn't take into account how many overwriting definitions there were
 *    - sum seems to be the most reasonable, maybe with stretched single alternative fitness 10? 
 *  - harder than branch coverage
 *  	- chromosomes more valuable!
 *  	- see part above about chromosome pool and initial population and stuff
 *  
 *  Questions:
 *   - BranchCoverageGoal also treats root branches with expression value true!
 *   - why does GA assume population.get(0) to be the best individual?
