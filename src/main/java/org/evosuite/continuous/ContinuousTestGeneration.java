/**
 * <p>
 * This is the main entry point for the new 
 * paradigm "Continuous Test Generation" (CTG).
 * This can be called directly from EvoSuite for
 * experiment reasons, but its usage for practitioners
 * will be based on build environments like Maven/Ant
 * and continuous integration environments like 
 * Jenkins/Hudson/Bamboo 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In a nutshell, the idea is for a project to keep track/store
 * the best test suite for each class in the project.
 * Each time CTG is run (and can be run continuously), we try
 * to generate test suites for classes we haven't addressed
 * yet, and we try to improve the current ones (by seeding).
 * Benefits are for example:
 * <ul>  
 * <li> No need to download EvoSuite. This is done automatically
 * with Maven </li>
 * <li> Smart allocation of search budget among classes with
 * different size/difficulty</li>
 * <li><b>Very</b> easily configurable to run 24/7, with reports on entire
 * project</li>
 * <li> Possibility to reuse test cases/data from one class to
 * help generation of test suites for new classes</li>
 * <li>Can automatically check from repository which classes
 * have been modified, and concentrate search on them</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * CTG can also be configured to "call home".
 * This will be useful to see how EvoSuite is used in practice.
