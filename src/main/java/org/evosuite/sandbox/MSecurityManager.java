		 * runtime (specifying which permissions are available for code from various principals) is represented by a Policy object. Whenever a Policy
		 * is initialized or refreshed, Permission objects of appropriate classes are created for all permissions allowed by the Policy. Many
		 * permission class types referenced by the policy configuration are ones that exist locally (i.e., ones that can be found on CLASSPATH).
		 * Objects for such permissions can be instantiated during Policy initialization. For example, it is always possible to instantiate a
		 * java.io.FilePermission, since the FilePermission class is found on the CLASSPATH. Other permission classes may not yet exist during Policy
		 * initialization. For example, a referenced permission class may be in a JAR file that will later be loaded. For each such class, an
		 * UnresolvedPermission is instantiated. Thus, an UnresolvedPermission is essentially a "placeholder" containing information about the
		 * permission. Later, when code calls AccessController.checkPermission on a permission of a type that was previously unresolved, but whose
		 * class has since been loaded, previously-unresolved permissions of that type are "resolved". That is, for each such UnresolvedPermission, a
		 * new object of the appropriate class type is instantiated, based on the information in the UnresolvedPermission. This new object replaces
		 * the UnresolvedPermission, which is removed.
		 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In theory it
		 * shouldn't really happen, unless some customized permission classes are used in the SUT. It also poses a problem: we might run a test case

		 * write permission for virtual files (that are stored in the virtual file system). That means, if we have something like 'new
		 * FileOutputStream(virtualFile)', no security exception is thrown, even if this security manager is active and would forbid write access. For
		 * original files the security manager behaves as specified. I know that I thereby partially violate the original specification of
		 * File/FileInputStream/FileOutputStream when to throw a security exception. The (not so nice) alternative I can think of, would be to check
		 * if Properties.VIRTUAL_FS is true, to analyze the current stack trace in this very method here and to allow write/execute access if there is
		 * File/FileInputStream/FileOutputStream in the stack trace. If you prefer this method (or a better one?) to be implemented (and to have
		 * File/FIS/FOS throw security exceptions also for virtual files), please let me know.
		 * 
		 * Reminder: EvoSuiteIO.shouldBeOriginal labels all File instances as 'virtual' files, that are created by the class under test while the VFS
		 * is enabled. If such a file instance exists on the real file system, it is copied into memory and all subsequent file operations (provided
		 * by the classes File/FIS/FOS) are performed on this in-memory copy. Nevertheless, there is an option to only allow existing files to be read
		 * from within the sandbox read folder (-Drestricted_read=true)
